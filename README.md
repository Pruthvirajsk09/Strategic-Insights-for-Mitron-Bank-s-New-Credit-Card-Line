# Project Overview
This project presents an interactive solution developed as part of a pilot project for Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. The primary goal is to analyze customer data and generate actionable insights to support the launch of a new line of credit cards.

The solution provides a comprehensive, visual representation of customer spending behavior and demographic patterns across five cities, enabling the strategy team to make data
driven decisions. It is designed specifically for top-level management and the product strategy team, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and insight-driven recommendations.


# Project Introduction
In today’s competitive financial market, understanding customer behavior is essential for developing targeted and successful product offerings. Financial institutions must leverage data-driven insights to design products that align with customer needs and market trends.

This project addresses a real-world business challenge where Mitron Bank seeks to introduce a new line of credit cards to expand its product portfolio and better serve its
customers. Using a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities, I developed an interactive, easy-to-use solution that helps the strategy team explore customer
demographics, online spending patterns, and regional trends.

The solution is tailored for decision-makers, providing clear visual insights to help shape the credit card’s features, marketing strategy, and customer targeting approach,
ultimately supporting Mitron Bank in making informed strategic decisions.

### 2) Data Collection and Exploration

Worked with the sample dataset of 4000 customers, which included customer demographics, online spend data, and city-wise information.

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, inconsistent data types.

### 3) Define Key Metrics and Insights
Based on guidance from the strategy team, identified important metrics to analyze, such as:

Customer spending patterns by category

Age and income distribution

City-wise customer segmentation

Payment type distribution

### 4) Develop Interactive Visual Solution

Analyzed customer trends and behavior to highlight:

Key customer segments for credit card targeting

Regional spending differences

Potential growth opportunities

Formulated data-driven recommendations to guide the product strategy.


# Top 10 Key Findings

### 1) Income Utilization is Moderate
Avg. income utilization is 42.82%, meaning people spend less than half of their income, suggesting some savings culture.

### 2) Salaried IT Employees Drive Income & Spending
They have the highest average utilization (47–54%) and also contribute the largest share of income (477M) and spending (203M).
This group is the most critical customer base.

### 3) Younger Groups (25–34, 35–45) are the Core Drivers
These age groups contribute ~70% of both income and spending.
Spending is highest in 25–34 (203M) while income is highest in 25–34 (466M).

### 4) Credit Cards Dominate Payments
Credit cards account for the largest share of spending (40.7%), especially in Bills, Travel, Electronics, and Apparel categories.
This indicates strong dependency on credit usage.

### 5) High Potential in Metro Cities
Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi NCR lead in both income and spending.
These metros should be the primary launch markets for a new credit card.

Males contribute ~67% of spending (357M) and higher income across all occupations.
Females spend proportionally more on Health & Wellness and Apparel, even though their income is lower.

Ideal time for credit card launches, festive offers, and bonus reward campaigns.
