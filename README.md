# Project Overview
This project presents an interactive solution developed as part of a pilot project for Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. The primary goal is to analyze customer data and generate actionable insights to support the launch of a new line of credit cards.

The solution provides a comprehensive, visual representation of customer spending behavior and demographic patterns across five cities, enabling the strategy team to make data
driven decisions. It is designed specifically for top-level management and the product strategy team, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and insight-driven recommendations.


# Project Introduction
In today’s competitive financial market, understanding customer behavior is essential for developing targeted and successful product offerings. Financial institutions must leverage data-driven insights to design products that align with customer needs and market trends.

This project addresses a real-world business challenge where Mitron Bank seeks to introduce a new line of credit cards to expand its product portfolio and better serve its
customers. Using a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities, I developed an interactive, easy-to-use solution that helps the strategy team explore customer
demographics, online spending patterns, and regional trends.

The solution is tailored for decision-makers, providing clear visual insights to help shape the credit card’s features, marketing strategy, and customer targeting approach,
ultimately supporting Mitron Bank in making informed strategic decisions.
